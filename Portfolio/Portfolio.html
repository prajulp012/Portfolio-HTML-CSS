		<h2><span>Foundation</span></h2><br>
		<p>Virat Kohli, former captain of the Indian men’s cricket team set up the Virat Kohli Foundation (VKF) in 2013 to fulfill his dream of making India a sporting superpower and supporting potential athletes to achieve their dreams and reach the pinnacle in their respective sport.

			Virat’s ambitions for a better India have grown beyond the sports arena to creating a better tomorrow for the underprivileged youth of our country. He is committed to build youth focused programs, which connect children to resources and use his partnerships to setup support services to the vulnerable section of our society.
			
			He and Anushka are both passionate about animals and they have made personal contributions consistently to help the cause of the thousands of stray animals in our city, as well as contributed to wildlife relief efforts. With his support extended to Awaaz, he can create well planned medical services, shelter and food to the strays that are the forgotten and often brutalised in Mumbai.
			
			We believe in research, and our team is constantly meeting with innovators and leading experts to understand the problems faced by our disadvantaged youth and how we can make the most of our resources to drive real action which will leave a lasting impact and build a better future for our India.
